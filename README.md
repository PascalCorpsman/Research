# Introduction
From time to time, I do some ‚Äúresearch.‚Äù By *research*, I mean testing and re-evaluating results I‚Äôve encountered from various sources ‚Äî books, YouTube videos, discussions with others, and more.  
In this repository, I share my findings with the world üòâ, hoping that others might also find them interesting.  

Each subfolder in the **Content** directory covers a different topic, presented in no particular order. Some folders may contain only links to content I‚Äôve already published, since I prefer not to duplicate my own work here.


| Folder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [CPU branch prediction](Content/CPU_branch_prediction_unit) | Demonstration evaluating the benefits of modern CPU branch prediction units and how this knowledge can be applied to writing more efficient code. |
| [GetTickCount64](Content/Gettickcount64) | Evaluating the behavior of GetTickCount64 on Windows64 and Linux64 and conclusing to the schedulers of the OS's. |
| [Cache compare](Content/Cache_Compare) | Evaluation of CPU cache prefetching strategies and code optimizations that take care of that. |
