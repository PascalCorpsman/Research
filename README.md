# Introduction
From time to time i do some "research", by research i hereby mean, that i try to test / reevaluate results that i have seen on different sources (books, youtube, disussions with others ..). In this repository i share my results with the world ;), in the hope that others are also interested in such results.

Every subfolder in this repository tackles a different topic in more or less random order (some may only contain links to already published content, as i do not want to republish already published content).


| Folder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [CPU branch prediction](CPU_branch_prediction_unit) | demo that evaluates the benefit on modern CPU Branch prediction and how we can benefit this knowledge into code writing |
